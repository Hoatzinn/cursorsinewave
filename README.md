# Sinewave movement for cursor (```Python```)
## Installation
You will need ```Python 3``` for this. Just search for it on the internet.

You will also have to install ```autopy``` and ```pyautogui``` with the following commands in your command prompt or terminal:

```pip install autopy``` or ```pip3 install autopy```

and

```pip install pyautogui``` or ```pip3 install pyautogui```
## Running
Use your preferred IDE (I personally just ```IDLE``` or ```VS Code```) or type

```python3 name-of-file-here.py```

in the command prompt or terminal.
